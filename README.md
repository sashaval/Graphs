# Graphs

A repository of graphs created using various technologies and database softwares.

Thus far, I've siphoned data from a CSV databse into an R project created using JupyterColab through Google Colab.
I then visually rendered the data to form a graph which showcases the progression of my current manuscript (work in progress).
