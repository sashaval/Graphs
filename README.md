# Graphs

A repository of graphs created using various technologies and database softwares.

## Obsidian Databases
Below is a render of a graph database made with Obsidian, based on my PSYCH 377 notes. Each note is a node on the graph, and each edge is a reference between two notes. 
For example, node (26.5)Tumors, mentions meningioma, which is a tumor originating in the meninges. This note contains an Obsidian backlink to the node (3.7)Meninges, creating an egde between them.

## Graphs in R

I've siphoned data from a CSV databse into an R project created using JupyterColab through Google Colab.
I then visually rendered the data to form a graph which showcases the progression of my current manuscript (work in progress).
